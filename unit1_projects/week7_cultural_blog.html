			<h3>Affirmations, Revisited.</h3>
			<p>I just looked back at my &ldquo;Affirming your values&rdquo; blog post. The two things that stood out are how much focus I place on my friendships, and how low I rated &ldquo;Creativity&rdquo; and &ldquo;Inventiveness&rdquo; the night I wrote that post.</p>
			<p>I actually value creativity and inventiveness very highly. Seeing how I rated them is a reminder of how much my outlook and point of view can change from moment to moment based on what&rsquo;s going on in my life. It also suggests that my outlook is going to be changing a lot from day to day while I&rsquo;m at DBC.</p>
			<p>The strong focus on close relationships and friendships also points out how much I think DBC is going to impact that part of my life. I&rsquo;ve decided to just take a leap and commit to staying in San Francisco after DBC. That means leaving 20 years worth of town, career, family and friends for what feels like a total reset.</p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m excited for that, but also a bit bewildered, anxious and sad too.</p>
			<h4>The connection to Stereotype Threat</h4>
			<p>Stereotype Threat, at it&rsquo;s base, it about conception of self, and how that &ldquo;self&rdquo; plugs into any given environment. One of the things that&rsquo;s interesting to me about being surrounded by people who have known me very well for many years, is that they hold a version of me that gets reflected back. When I&rsquo;ve expressed doubt about DBC, they&rsquo;ve reminded me that I can do this. Not because they&rsquo;re being nice, but because they&rsquo;ve seen me do things like this before. &ldquo;Oh, yeah. You&rsquo;re right. I forgot for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Stereotype threat is often an unconscious process. Your sense of self, sense of ability, and sense of values gets all mushy without you necessarily realizing it. SF will initially be a place where I won&rsquo;t have the same kind of reminders from others about my self in moments where I forget. The values exercise is a way to fill in for that. It&rsquo;s a mindfulness exercise that can help sort out the genuine interior from the exterior of the moment.</p>
			<p>Keeping up a meditation practice, exercise, activities that are fun and have nothing to do with DBC, getting together with the few friends and family members I have in SF, and taking time to look over that values list are all things I think I&rsquo;ll be relying on in the next few months. And, of course, I&rsquo;m really looking forward to building new friendships. (As well as visits from old peeps.)</p>
