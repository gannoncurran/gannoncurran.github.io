			<h3>Culture and values.</h3>
			<p></p>
			<h5>Q: When you think of the times in your life where you've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?<br><br>A:</h5>
			<p>Accomplishment<br>Close relationships<br>Helping other people<br>Helping society<br>Independence<br>Personal development<br>Self-reliance<br>Creativity<br>Inventiveness<br>Friendships<br>Humor</p>

			<h4>Friendships</h4>
			<p>I went to a show with a group of old friends that I hadn't seen in a long time. I've known them for over 15 years, and while we no longer see each other very often, there was a time when we were together very frequently and were essentially each other's "chosen family". We shared in-jokes from our past, and made plans for future get togethers. It was great to spend time with people who know me in a deep and genuine way. I'm amazed by, and thankful for new friends who are becoming familiar, close, and loved in the same way. Having a sense of "place" and "self" that lives in others helps me feel grounded.</p>

			<h4>Solicited advice:</h4>
			<p>Strangely, the last topic I gave advice on was technically medicine. A friend of mine wanted to know if I thought he should go to the doctor since his foot still hurt a little after it had been trapped under the wheel of a cab the night before. (Cabbie rolled forward while friend was getting in.) Uh, dude if you're not sure you're ok, then, yes.</p>
