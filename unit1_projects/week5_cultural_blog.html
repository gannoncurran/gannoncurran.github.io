			<h3>Breaking Up the Sausagefest.</h3>
			<p>Oh boy here we go. A guy writing about women's issues.</p>
			<p>While challenges faced by women in the workplace aren't specific to the tech industry, it's a space where the problems at large are present to an extreme degree. STEM fields are still pretty boyclub.</p>
			<p>Here's why I'm writing about it: even though I'm male, I've found I'm much more comfortable in mixed gender environments. Since I'm now pursuing a leap from a creative field (where I've typically had lots of female co-workers) to the technology industry proper, the gender count has been on my mind.</p>
			<p>Some background: I was raised by parents that, for their generation, were atypical in their gender roles. The one who made breakfast every morning and gave weepy hugs when my sister or I came off stage after a high-school play? Dad. The one who handled the family finances and was quick to fight any threat to family or friend? Cue Mom.</p>
			<p>For the record, Dad also taught me to run a drill press, and mom taught my sister how to make a good pie crust, so there was plenty of tradition in there too. Regardless, they gave me an unusual perspective on gender expectations.</p>
			<p>Moreover, I'm not particularly butch. In both my professional and personal lives I've found I'm happier, more able to be myself, more relaxed, creative and confident in groups where both men and women were active, equal, and respectful members of the group. I appreciate the widened perspective and insight that can result. (Despite the occasional sigh or eye roll.)</p>
			<p>So we all know the deal in the tech industry. Women are extraordinarily underrepresented. Aside from my personal preference, why does it matter? Why should we strive for balanced gender participation in STEM fields?</p>
			<p>There are obvious reasons of economic fairness, but to me, there's something equally important. Writing code is ultimately about getting things done in the real world. It's about providing some kind of utility to the end user. Technology has proven to be a powerful cultural force, dramatically shaping and reshaping our culture and day to day existence. Making good choices about the paths we choose to follow requires broad perspective, and I think women and men working together can do a better job at meeting the wants and needs of the world at large.</p>
			<p>So what's to be done? I can't pretend to have much of an answer, other than patience, and perseverance. I can say I've found the recently published excerpt from the Katty Kay and Claire Shipman book <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/04/the-confidence-gap/359815/" target="_blank">The Confidence Gap</a> insightful and illuminating, and I've long appreciated Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Cain-Protecting-Emotional-Life/dp/0345434854" target="_blank">Raising&nbsp;Cain</a> for its insight on the experience of growing up male. Both reveal experiences of men and women that are often hidden. Bringing those experiences forward can open dialog, and a good conversation can be a step in the right direction.</p>
